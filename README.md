Garbage Distribution

1. What is my project and what does it do?<br>
My project uses ML to teach the computer to distribute the different types of garbage (paper, cardboard, etc.). The program runs in Python and with my code I've created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that trains the model based on images from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zlatan599/garbage-dataset-classification?resource=download.<br>
2. Why I made this project?<br>
I wanted to analyze data. Where I live, there's currently a crisis with the collection of garbage, so the topic is very relatable.<br>
3. How did I make my project?<br>
In Python, following steps that I've learned in the GWC Pathways program in their course "Data Science + AI".<br>
4. What did I struggle with and what did I learn?<br>
I struggled with uploading the files to github and having them to work. I had to use LFS (Large Files Storage) to be able to upload them. I also had a few problem with commiting the changes I've made to my files to GitHub. Down you can see a screenshot of my failed commits (to prove that I've tried doing them regularly, but it didn't work in the beginning).<br>
Unfortunately, pyinstaller didn't work for me. To run the project without downloading the files, go to this link: https://raliisaeva-garbage-distr-bbdq9m9pp3.app.codeanywhere.com/. Then, you'll have to register into the app and afterwards, when you've already in the app through my link, you'll get a message in the right down corner "Port 8000 is now available." and from there click "Open in browser."<br>
You can also just go straight to this link (after actually registering in codeanywhere.com and opening my project link): https://8000-raliisaeva-garbage-distr-bbdq9m9pp3.app.codeanywhere.com/<br>

Running the program online instructions:
1) Go to link: https://raliisaeva-garbage-distr-bbdq9m9pp3.app.codeanywhere.com/.
2) Register/log in into the website codeanywhere.com and then continue to my link
3) You'll see a message in the right down corner "Port 8000 is now available." and from there click "Open in browser." If you don't see the message, just go to https://8000-raliisaeva-garbage-distr-bbdq9m9pp3.app.codeanywhere.com

The following screenshots are:
1) First version of the model/program
2) Failed commits to GitHub (before first submission)<br>
3) The message to look for after registering into codeanywhere.com and following the link https://raliisaeva-garbage-distr-bbdq9m9pp3.app.codeanywhere.com/
